# 10-Payment

This service is responsible for payments in RoboShop e-commerce app.

This service is written on `Python 3`, So need it to run this app.

CentOS 7 comes with `Python 2` by default. So we need `Python 3` to be installed.

1. Install Python 3

```sql
# yum install python36 gcc python3-devel -y
```

1. Create a user for running the application

```sql
# useradd roboshop
```

1. Download the repo.

```sql
$ cd /home/roboshop
$ curl -L -s -o /tmp/payment.zip "https://github.com/roboshop-devops-project/payment/archive/main.zip"
$ unzip /tmp/payment.zip
$ mv payment-main payment
```

1. Install the dependencies

```bash
# cd /home/roboshop/payment 
# pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
