# 07-MySQL

MySQL is the database service which is needed for the application. So we need to install it and configure it for the application to work.

## **Manual Steps to Install MySQL**

As per the Application need, we are choosing MySQL 5.7 version.

1. Setup Repo

On Centos-7

```bash
# curl -s -L -o /etc/yum.repos.d/mysql.repo https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roboshop-devops-project/mysql/main/mysql.repo
```

On Centos-8

```bash
# curl -s -L -o /etc/yum.repos.d/mysql.repo https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roboshop-devops-project/mysql/main/mysql.repo
# dnf module disable mysql
```

1. Install MySQL

```bash
# yum install mysql-community-server -y
```

1. Start MySQL.

```bash
# systemctl enable mysqld 
# systemctl start mysqld
```

1. Now a default root password will be generated and given in the log file.

```bash
# grep temp /var/log/mysqld.log
```

1. Next, We need to change the default root password in order to start using the database service. Use password `RoboShop@1` or any other as per your choice. Rest of the options you can choose `No`

```bash
# mysql_secure_installation
```

First lets connect to MySQL

```bash
# mysql -uroot -pRoboShop@1
```

Once after login to MySQL prompt then run this SQL Command.

```sql
> uninstall plugin validate_password;
```
